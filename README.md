# Runoff
This program simulates a runoff election similar in function to my plurality election simulator (https://github.com/brianzhang927/plurality), but upgraded with a ranked-choice voting system.

### Motivation
This was motivated by Harvard's CS50 and partly includes their distribution code in the "runoff.c" file.

### Usage
Usage: ./runoff [candidate...]
